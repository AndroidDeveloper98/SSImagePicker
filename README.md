Easy to use and configurable library to **Pick an image from the Gallery or Capture image using Camera**.

You can easily select image from camera and gallery and upload it wherever you want. I have created this library to simplify pick or capture image feature.

# Features : 

* Capture Image Using Camera
* Pick Image From Gallery
* Handle Runtime Pemission For Storage And Camera
* ImagePicker Bottomsheet 
* Retrieve Image Result In Uri Format
* Crop Image (Coming Soon...)
* Customise Image Picker BottomSheet (Coming Soon...)

# How it works:

1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
    allprojects {
    		repositories {
    			...
    			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    		}
    	}
```
2. Add the dependency in your app's build.gradle file

```
    dependencies {
    	        implementation 'com.github.SimformSolutionsPvtLtd:SSImagePicker:-SNAPSHOT'
    	}
```
3. Use ImagePicker Bottomsheet To Choose Option For Pick Image From Gallery Or Camera

```
    val fragment = ImagePickerBottomsheet()
    fragment.show(FragmentManager, String) 
```
4. Allow Camera And Storage Permission To Pick Image And Send Your onRequestPermissionsResult To ImagePickerActivity

```
    override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<out String>, grantResults: IntArray) 
    {
         imagePicker.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
    }
```

5. Call ImagePickerActivityClass To Handle Camera, Gallery Click And Permission Result. Pass Context, Activity And Request Permission Result Callback:

```
    var imagePicker = ImagePickerActivityClass(Context,Activity,onResult_Callback)
```
6. To Capture Image From Camera Use takePhotoFromCamera()

```
    imagePicker.takePhotoFromCamera()
```
7. To Pick Image From Gallery Use choosePhotoFromGallary()

```
    imagePicker.choosePhotoFromGallary()
```

8. You Will Get Image Result In Uri Format In returnString() And Customize It To Upload 

```
     override fun returnString(item: Uri?) {
            **Here You Will Get Your Image Result In Uri Format**
        }
```
